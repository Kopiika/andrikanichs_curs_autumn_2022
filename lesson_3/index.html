			<h2 class="header">Why Finding the Easiest Way to Learn English Might Not Be So Simple</h2>

			<div class="block-text">

				<p class="text">You&#39;re not the only person who is looking for the easiest way to learn English.
					Scientists and linguists (people who study languages) have been trying to find it for years. There have
					been many studies about how our brains process different languages and language learning, especially in
					children (who seem to have much less trouble learning new languages).</p>

				<p class="text">The problem is that many of the studies are contradictory—which means they say opposite
					things. Some studies say one way is the best, while other studies say a different method works better.
				</p>
			</div>

			<p class="text">In reality, there is no single easiest way to learn English. Why? Because of you, the English learner! You&#39;re not the same as all English learners, of course. Things like age, location, past learning experience, time spent learning, creativity and so many other factors affect how you learn.</p>

				
			<p class="text">You might learn the best when you&#39;re listening to an audiobook, but your friend might prefer taking a structured class. You might gain a lot from English textbooks, or you might learn the most from watching an English movie every week. How you learn, what you enjoy and how you think will determine which method works best.</p>
						
				
			<p class="text">Before we get to the methods, here&#39;s some good news: No matter what you&#39;ve been doing to learn so far, research says you can always catch up. So if you didn&#39;t begin with the immersion method, for example, you can still gain the same benefits once you start. In other words, it&#39;s never too late to try something new!</p>
							
				
			<p class="text">So take a look below, and find the easiest way to learn English—for you.</p>

		<!-- Three methods -->
		<div id="three-methods" class="block-three-methods">

			<h2 class="header">3 Proven Methods to Learn English Easily</h2>

			<p class="text">Here are three of the most powerful English learning methods. You&#39;ve probably already used
				them, or at least seen them in use. The trick is to figure out which method works best for you.</p>

			<p class="text">We&#39;ll show you how to effectively use these methods in your studies below.</p>

			<!-- 1. Immersion method -->
			<div id="immersion-method" class="block-immersion-method">

				<h3 class="header">The Immersion Method</h3>

				<p class="text">The immersion method is also called the “natural method.” The word “immersion” means to
					become completely surrounded by something. To learn by immersion, you need to surround yourself with
					English, all the time.</p>

				<div class="block-science-says">
					<h4 class="subheader">Science says:</h4>

					<p class="text">This method doesn&#39;t just help you learn English, <a target="_blank"
							href="https://www.fluentu.com/blog/english/how-to-think-in-english/">it helps you think like a
							native</a>. Using the immersion method to learn English actually changes the way your brain works,
						to look more like the brain of a native English speaker.
					</p>

					<p class="text">This method also exposes you to more English every day. This is important because
						according to some studies, you might be able to get a good grasp on English by studying one hour per
						day, but it won&#39;t be easy to get to a native level of understanding.
					</p>

					<p class="text">Why does this work? Think about how babies learn. They come into the world not knowing
						any words, and are immediately surrounded by a strange language. Little by little, from listening to
						this language used and watching other people, they learn certain words.</p>

					<p class="text">Then they learn how these words are put together. Finally, they start speaking fluently.
						That&#39;s why this method is called “natural”—the more you surround yourself with English, the easier
						you&#39;ll learn.
					</p>

				</div>

				<div class="block-try-method">
					<h4 class="subheader">Try this method if you…</h4>

					<ul class="list">
						<li class="item">are living in an English-speaking country.</li>
						<li class="item">are having trouble learning by memorizing grammar rules.</li>
						<li class="item">want to begin <a target="_blank"
								href="https://www.fluentu.com/blog/english/learn-conversational-english/">having conversations
								in English faster</a>.</li>
						<li class="item">learn best through speaking and listening.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="block-how-learn">
					<h4 class="subheader">How to learn by immersion:</h4>
					<p class="text">To learn with this method, you will need to surround yourself with English. If you&#39;re
						living in an English-speaking country, you&#39;re already halfway there! Here are some things you can
						do to expose yourself to more English every day:</p>

					<ul class="list">
						<li class="item">Change the language to English on your phone, social media and any other websites you
							use regularly.</li>
						<li class="item">Join online and real-world groups that speak in English. Find groups that share your
							interests, so you have something in common to talk about.</li>
						<li class="item">Speak to your fellow English students in English as often as you can.
						</li>
						<li class="item">Watch TV shows and movies in English. Even if you don&#39;t understand the words,
							you&#39;re learning patterns without even realizing it.</li>
						<li class="item">Watch the news and listen to the radio in English. Subscribe to an English magazine
							or newspaper. Make English the first language you see every day!</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="subblock-useful-websites">
					<h4 class="subheader">Useful websites</h4>
					<p class="text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fluentu.com/english/">FluentU</a> is a program that
						immerses you in authentic English videos like movie clips, music videos and news segments. But instead
						of letting you watch videos without understanding them, the program includes many tools for learners
						to make sense of what they&#39;re watching and hearing.
					</p>
					<p class="text">For example, if you hear a word you don&#39;t know in a video, you can move your mouse
						over it to see a quick meaning. Click on the word for a full definition, grammar information, audio
						pronunciations, example sentences (also with audio) and clips from other videos where you can hear the
						word used again.</p>
					<p class="text">You can make flashcards from any word, take quizzes after each video and complete
						personalized exercises to practice vocabulary words and more. And if you&#39;re on the iOS or Android
						app, FluentU even lets you practice your pronunciation skills with speaking questions.</p>
					<p class="text">If you want to practice your reading skills more, one great option for subscribing to
						English-language magazines is Magazine Line. Not only do they have a large selection of magazines for
						all kinds of interests, but you can get discounted (lowered) prices, so you don&#39;t have to spend
						too much on quality reading material.</p>
					<p class="text">You can also use Meetup to find English practice groups that meet in person, or search
						Facebook for groups to join.</p>
				</div>
			</div>


			<!-- 2. Classroom method -->
			<div id="classroom-method" class="block-classroom-method">
				<h3 class="header">The Classroom Method</h3>

				<p class="text">Don&#39;t skip this one just because you don&#39;t take English classes! Classroom English
					learning doesn&#39;t mean you have to take formal English classes. It just means you learn like you would
					if you were in a classroom.</p>

				<p class="text">With the classroom method, you start with the grammar rules, spelling and vocabulary
					lessons, and the foundation of the language. These are the parts that hold it together.</p>

				<div class="block-science-says">
					<h4 class="subheader">Science says:</h4>

					<p class="text">Before you can start speaking a language, you need some basic knowledge. Otherwise, where
						would you start? According to some studies, learning a language is a bit like building. You start with
						a few basics, like “I walked to school,” then you add to them little by little.</p>

					<p class="text">As you learn the rules, you can start creating your own sentences with them, and even
						making mistakes. For example, “I sing at school” is correct, but “I singed at school” is not (it
						should be “sang”). You advance by building your knowledge, making mistakes and learning from the whole
						process.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="block-try-method">
					<h4 class="subheader">Try this method if you…</h4>

					<ul class="list">
						<li class="item">like structure and order when you&#39;re learning.</li>
						<li class="item">don&#39;t feel comfortable jumping into conversations unless you know enough grammar
							and vocabulary.</li>
						<li class="item">prefer to study for a chunk of time each day instead of surrounding yourself with
							English all day.</li>
						<li class="item">want to understand English deeply, not just know how to speak it.</li>
						<li class="item">are a beginner to English.</li>
						<li class="item">learn best in a classroom setting, or will be taking English classes.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="block-how-learn">

					<h4 class="subheader">How to learn with the classroom method:</h4>

					<p class="text">To learn with the classroom method, you need some structure. You can learn this way in a
						classroom or at home, but it helps to have someone to help you along, like a tutor. That person can
						tell you when you&#39;re making your (very important) mistakes. To learn by the classroom method, try
						these tips:</p>

					<ul class="list">
						<li class="item">Sign up for English classes. (This one makes sense, doesn&#39;t it?)</li>
						<li class="item">If you&#39;re not taking a course, find a tutor or a native speaker willing to help
							you.</li>
						<li class="item">Get a few good textbooks. It&#39;s a good idea to have different kinds of textbooks
							(one for grammar, one for vocabulary), or just one big textbook that separates the learning by
							type. This way you can focus on one thing at a time when you&#39;re studying.</li>
						<li class="item">Find some good online resources for testing yourself, like interactive learning
							websites or quizzes.</li>
						<li class="item">Set aside a block of time every day for studying.</li>
						<li class="item">Don&#39;t let yourself forget the things you&#39;ve already learned. Refresh your
							memory often by reviewing old notes. One day of studying each week can even be dedicated to review.
						</li>
					</ul>

				</div>

			<!-- The Dual Method -->
			<div id="dual-method" class="block-dual-method">
				<h3 class="header">The Dual Method</h3>
				<p class="text">Does it sound like the two methods above would work great together? They do! It&#39;s called
					the dual method, and it combines the immersion and classroom methods of learning.</p>
				<p class="text">Remember when we said you need to start from somewhere? The dual method usually starts with
					classroom learning, and then adds immersion elements for half of the study time.</p>

				<div class="block-science-says">
					<h4 class="subheader">Science says:</h4>
					<p class="text">Research usually agrees that it&#39;s a good idea to start with some basics, then move into
						immersion. The research doesn&#39;t always agree, though, about when that switch should be made.</p>
					<p class="text">One study looked at how well students in bilingual classrooms (using two languages) do
						compared to immersive classrooms (all English, all the time). Results show that the kids learned faster
						by immersion at first, but eventually slowed down. Bilingual students learned slower, but in the end they
						learned more.</p>
					<p class="text">If you&#39;re wondering what these kids have to do with you, just remember: Even if
						you&#39;re learning through the classroom method, one day you will need to start speaking to actual
						people in English. When do you make that switch? Dual immersion lets you start off ready to speak, while
						also teaching you the rules of the English language.</p>
				</div>	

				<div class="block-try-method">
					<h4 class="subheader">Try this method if you…</h4>
					<ul class="list">
						<li class="item">have the time to dedicate to both classroom and immersion learning. The benefit is that more time spent studying means faster progress.</li>
						<li class="item">learn well in a classroom setting, but also want to learn how to speak.
						</li>
						<li class="item">are taking courses that are taught in English.</li>
						<li class="item">are living in an English-speaking country.</li>
						<li class="item">are at an intermediate or advanced level of English.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="block-how-learn">
					<h4 class="subheader">How to learn with the dual method:</h4>
					<p class="text">The dual method is the best for intermediate English learners. It&#39;s a good option if you feel that you&#39;re ready to start using English in your daily life, but still want to learn in a structured way.</p>
					<p class="text">
						Since the dual method is a combination of both immersion and classroom, you can combine the tips and links for the previous two sections. Make sure you also follow these tips:</p>
					<ul class="list">
						<li class="item">Don&#39;t overwork yourself. Remember to take breaks, and to set aside times for English study. Studying for too long can actually harm your learning!</li>
						<li class="item">Try to find a good balance. One way to do this is to learn something new in the morning, then use it throughout the day. For example, if you learn about the past tense in the morning, try telling a friend about your weekend or about the last movie you watched.</li>
						<li class="item">Meet weekly with a language exchange partner. Even if you have a tutor or take classes, a language exchange partner can help you by letting you use your own language to learn.</li>
					</ul>
