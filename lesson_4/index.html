			<h2 class="subtittle northern-lights">Sleep under the Northern Lights</h2>
			<p class="paragraph">In Finland, you can view nature's most spectacular light show, the Aurora Borealis, from purpose-built spaces like glass huts and luxury suites.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">Did you know that the Northern Lights are visible roughly 200 nights a year in Finnish Lapland? While many choose to go Aurora-spotting by snowshoe, ski, snowmobile or dog sled, you can also view the Northern Lights from the comfort of the indoors. Here are a few places to stay cosy and sleep well without missing out on the show.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">Note: In Finland, nights are typically dark enough to see the Northern Lights from late August to April – all you need are clear skies and a bit of luck. Head north for the best chance of catching them.</p>
	
			<ul class="list hotels">
				<li class="item">Arctic Treehouse Hotel, Rovaniemi
					<p class="text">Located on the Arctic Circle in Rovaniemi, these 37 tree houses have warm, wooden interiors that showcase Scandinavian design and Lappish heritage.

			<img src="img/reindeer_farm.jpeg" alt="Kisess with the reindeer" class="photo">
			<h2 class="subtittle">Blaze through Arctic nature</h2>
			<p class="paragraph">At Pyhä, you can take a guided electric snowmobile tour that's fast and fun – without noise or fumes! Hop aboard one of these Finnish-built eSleds in Pyhä – one of the first places offering them – to see for yourself.</p>
			<p class="paragraph">Looking for a more traditional way to get around? Try a reindeer safari. You'll take a seat inside a comfy sleigh and watch as stunning scenery passes you by. Plus, reindeer herders usually carry treats, including traditional Finnish cinnamon buns and coffee, which you can enjoy alongside a roaring campfire while you learn <a class="link" href="https://www.visitfinland.com/en/articles/where-can-I-see-a-reindeer/">all about reindeer</a>.</p>

			<h2 class="subtittle">Experience the magic of Christmas in Santa's hometown</h2>
			<p class="paragraph"><a class="link" href="https://www.visitrovaniemi.fi/attraction/santa-claus-village/">Santa Claus Village</a> is one of Lapland's best-known attractions, and for good reason – where else can you meet Father Christmas in person, all year round? While seeing Santa is obviously the main attraction, Santa Village has plenty of shops, restaurants and cafés to keep visitors busy and entertained. Hop in a sleigh and go for a husky or reindeer ride, or take an exciting snowmobile tour. For a dose of adorable, visit the petting zoo to interact with rabbits, alpacas and other furry creatures. Mrs. Claus even has her own cabin where you can decorate gingerbread cookies alongside the elves!</p>

		<div class="block" id="snow-castles">
			<h2 class="subtittle">Sleep, drink and dine in castles of snow and ice</h2>
			<p class="paragraph">Thanks to an abundance of the white stuff, Finns are expert snow-builders. In Rovaniemi, you can sleep in a snow hotel, get married in a snow chapel, or build a snow hut under expert supervision (then sleep in it!). You can also dine in a snow restaurant, have a drink in an ice bar, and play in a snow castle.</p>
			<div class="section">
				<p class="paragraph text">One place to do it is the <a class="link" href="https://www.laplandhotels.com/EN/hotels-in-lapland/yllas/lapland-hotels-snowvillage.html">Lapland Hotels Snow Village</a>, near Ylläs and Levi. This unique and magical world is constructed each year from ice and snow – about 20 million kilos of snow and 350,000 kilos of ice, to be exact! The design changes annually but often includes things like ice sculptures, snow suites, and ice restaurants and bars.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Similarly, Finns have been building an astonishing snow and ice castle in Kemi since the mid-90s. This structure's glittering walls, shimmering pathways and sparkling snow sculptures will definitely leave you awestruck. You can even stay overnight in the Snow Hotel! And don't worry – if you happen to visit Kemi during the summer months, you can still take part in the fun at the year-round Snow Experience.</p>

			<h2 class="subtittle icebreaker">Hop aboard a mighty icebreaker</h2>
			<p class="paragraph"><a class="link" href="https://visitkemi.fi/kohde/icebreaker-sampo/?lang=en">Arctic Icebreaker Sampo </a>previously ploughed the frozen seas of Finland for trade before becoming a tourist attraction in Kemi in the late 1980s. Today, this majestic vessel takes visitors on truly unique cruises. Prepare to be awestruck when you hear the thundering sound of more than 3,500 tons of steel breaking through the thick ice of the Gulf of Bothnia!</p>
			<p class="paragraph">But that's not all Sampo cruises have to offer. You'll also get a guided tour of the ship, complete with visits to the engine room and the captain's bridge, and have the chance to swim in the freezing sea. Yes, you read that right, but don't worry – it's not required. If you do take that leap of faith, though, rest-assured that you'll be wearing a survival suit.</p>
